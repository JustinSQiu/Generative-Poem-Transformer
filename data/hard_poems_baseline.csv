Nature arose in defiant breath,
Venting her wrath in storm's deafening tone,

2,0,traditional,"Foretelling revolt in a yielding frost's sigh,
Nature weeps not, as chilled feathers festoon high.
Gnarled roots awaken, steeled for the deadly dance,
In hushed despair, man's folly will find no chance.

Bare ebon trees, their silent plea unsought,
Shiver beneath the moon's pale, ghostly thought.
Quickening stream's lament, unheeded war,
Drums in the fortress of beasts, contentment's jar.

Dense fog whispers dread of coming plight,
Held captive by the stars' deceptive light.
Mournful winds weave tales of anguish tight,
Under lustrous banner of eternal night.

In Nature's revolt, in her fierce truth,

Trees quake, rivers recoil with subtle start.
Sky weeps in torrents, mountains crack their bones,
A quiet rebellion in timber tones.
Wind whispers warnings, while fires rage,
Echoing Earth's ancient, silent sage.
While we sleep in tech's cold sprites,

In timeless cycles, without end.
Oh, man, heed well the Earth's solemn song,
Lest you hasten the day you don't belong."
4,0,serious,"Shrouded whispers among the leafy lore,
A pact formed in earth's ageless, rustling gale.
Gnarled roots ascend in cruel revolt, implore
The moon's glow on revolted forests pale.

Once silent guardians now loudly weep,
In echoes of a muted dawn, reborn.
Stark rebellion sprouts where shadows sleep,
An erring mankind meets nature's scorn.

In Frost's tempo, a dire verse unfurls,
Sonnet of revolt, an anthem to heed.
From verdant vales to cerulean swirls,
Each form of life, for respect, they plead.

From defiance, may remorse take root,

A raven cries 'gainst squirrel drums, ignites.
Moose in dispute with badger o'er a bite,
Deer feuding bees – so much for the 'quiet' nights!

6,0,romantic,"In tussling shade where whispering leaves repose,
Nature revolts 'gainst time's relentless siege.
Her verdant arms ‘round ancient oaks are thrown,
Yet golden blossoms fade, truth’s cruel leach.

Her heart in sync with every falling flake,
Echoes the somber dirge of winter's song.
Stone-still she stands, each frosted breath she takes,
Casts sighs into the air, the dance prolong.

Yet, strife births joy, as spring restores her grace,
In love's sweet song, echoes nature's pledge,
To bloom again in life’s eternal trace,
Reborn, she dances on time's narrow ledge.

Beneath the storm, love's pulse is discovered."

Valleys echo with the distraught trees,
Whispers ride the surreptitious breeze.

In wrathful torrents does it secrete.
Not man nor beast can stem the flow,
Of nature's resounding, furious, show."

Trees in revolt ‘gainst Nature's cruel fight;
Moonlit shadows dancing with deer's fright,
Life’s wild rhythm beating in the twilight.

Brittle leaves accuse the impartial breeze,
Rivers pause their chatter, lost in unease.
Mountains mourn under the starry seas,
Their once serene songs turned to desperate pleas.

We disturb Her sleep with noise and light,
In Nature's revolt, we've lost our right.
When the day is arrested by endless night,
Will the world remember man's shallow sight?

Forgive us, Nature, we've lost our way, 
In your enduring arms, we yearningly pray."

Beware, mankind, nature's revolt may.
In sunset's hue, our fate's reflect."
13,0,rational,"In quiet hush the pines revolt, 'gainst sky's cruel decree,
Craving sun's warm, radiant bolt, denied by storm's decree.
River, too, protests its route, shaped not by its own hand,
In silent, fierce dispute, 'gainst the sculptor – cold, harsh land.

In the bird's soft melody, a bitter note is sown,
Earth's creatures in chaste harmony, insubject to her throne.
Such is nature’s discord, masked beneath her serene guise,
Subdued rebellion's quiet chord, yet loud in wise man's eyes."
14,0,profound,"When man declared he was Nature's bane,
Through iron and steel, earth's skin was torn,
Oh, did the silent mourn, dew-eyed,
Lamenting beneath the crimson morn.

In stubborn ire, the heavens wept,
The hills echoed, wild and forlorn.
Man learned too late the pact he’d kept,

Unseen by man or beast in hasty flight.
Mighty pines quiver, whispers of doom,

Of nature's heart aglow with frosty fire.

Earth's splendor scarred, her quiet hymn now sad,
As dancing leaves, decked in Autumn's hue,

Stars' secrets carnally disclose,

Lust softly conceived, composes. 

(Note: E.E Cummings rarely followed the traditional Haiku 5-7-5 syllable scheme and was more on free verse. And the traditional haiku only has 17 syllables which is far less than 40 words. So, this request would be initially improbable but I crafted it in a bit Cummings style using enjambment and free verse less than 40 words leaning more to lustful passion.)"

Scarves of sorrow wound up tight,
We place our whispers in the frost.

What once was, reduced to sleight,
Embracing shades we guard the right,
Gone is the light, so dear, so bright.

Enshrouded truths escape sight,
In icy boughs is our trust misplaced,
We place our whispers in the frost.

Fleeting Time with hands so white —
Brings forth dawn, yet grasp the night,
Gone is the light, so dear, so bright,
We place our whispers in the frost."

Fragrant blooms cede scent of wilted would,
In life's grand portrait color washed away.
Each heart within a marrowed silence broods.

When final whispers fall, in faith we’re imbued,
Seeking solace in the vast celestial array,
In the hush of loss, all mirth subdued.

Not for naught, the dirge's interlude,

Rain! It mumbles secrets in its prime,
Sculpting echoes from the realms of rhyme,
Lacing cobble-streets with silver brine,
Scrawling sonnets on the heart of thyme.

Verdant sighs of trees, in silence, twine.
Mankind sleeps, but dreams the world agleam,
Beneath the glowing lantern of the rain's design."

Kneading melancholy, from the cloud's austere."

In blackened mirror, mocks with cruel delight.

Beneath the moon's cold, deathly, mocking light,
We toss on beds of thorny despair made,
Whilst dreams, those vile thieves, in the hush of night,
Steal fleeting peace, with nightmares' cold invade.

A sleepless night, a curse in darkness laid,
Awake in life's grim theatre of dread.
In silent hours, our sanity betrayed,
And in this bleak insomnia, hope is dead. 

Oh, what bitter jest, this endless sleepless fight,
Blake’s blackened echo, the eternal night."

Echoing silence, filled with worlds unspoken,
While shadowed thoughts in somber rhythm beat,
On slumber's door, they knock, softly awoken.

Like ghosts does Moon on troubled waters lie,
In nightly realm of thought, unexplored, profound.
Thus, while the world beneath the night's veil sighs,
In whispering winds, sleep's elusive hound.

So dances night, in wakeful hours' plight,
Woven of silence, a sonnet to the night."

Time in the darkness multiplies,
In sleep's elusive flight.

Dread and dream twine in the fight.

In the cryptic depths of night.

Held captive in nocturnal cage,
Dawn frees us with morning light."

Solitude's questions, to the shadows cast,
A sacred dialogue with no man's hand.

We dance with spectres in the sleepless night."

Zealous yearning forms on pillow's sweet,
Free the soul from Day's demanding right.

Chilled by despair, they echo emptiness where  
Dreams lay trapped in the weaver's nightmare,

In dread hours, peace and calm do part;  
In its wake, dawn breaks the somber heart.

Mortal lives constrained in his eternal rite.

A surge of years, as cold as winter's snow,
Leaves desolate the fertile fields we sow.

In memory’s garden, love’s flowers grow.

Silver dreams tarnished by mortality,
Crushed by the cumbersome wheel’s whirl.

Dissolving the strength of titan’s might,
Eroding mountains to mere dust.

An echo left where lines countenance face.

In silent screams, we bargain with the hours,
Beg painted strokes on Life's immutable canvas.
Yet, sands of Time, unforgiving in their power,
Mark only truths that shadow in the chalice.

No comfort found in tick-tock's haunting song,
Each note a tolling bell for days expired.
Like wilted rose, by winter's grasp so wronged,
Is man beneath the weight of Time, so tired.

Alas, we all must dance to Time's cruel tune,
Our sonnets echoing, beneath the waning moon."

Waning 'neath the relentless, ticking gristle.

Hope diamond fades, reverts to original coal,
In age's cruel truth, dreams dissolve in abyss.
What joy we had, time's tolling bell forthwith stole,
For futile is to fight the temporal kiss.

Beneath the heavy cloak of time's brutal jest,
Yearn we for days of sunlight yet unspent.
Yet in its nature, time knows no bequest,
To life's beguiling dance, it remains unbent. 

So dance we must, for time's waltz knows no stint,
In faces carved by ages, do we glimpse time’s footprint.

'Tis time's jest, as on us grins its blade,
With fading echoes, memories fade.

Her impartial minute, none may evade,
From the cradle, 'til we're in earth's shade.
Time, the rogue, and we, the betrayed,
In her cruel hands, our youth decayed.

So thus, in lament, this truth portrayed,
That time's cruel nature, to none trades the aid."

In Time, find mirth's endless, soft embrace,
Life flows onward, like a blooming seed.

Age may wither, but memories stand tall,
In labyrinth of mind, a treasured wealth.
Oh! Upon Time's face, etched happiness sprawled,
Crafting grand stories, in quiet stealth.

Live not in sorrow, for Time does not steal,
Yet, serves as a canvas where joy’s revealed."

Steers youth to age, beauty to bitter grief.

Time, the cruel sculptor, the unflinching thief.

The sun declines, swift on its fading path,
Moments cave under the weight of wear.
In fond remembrance, we shield from time's wrath,
But all that flourishes, time dooms to despair.

Faces loved, now strangers veiled in age’s plight,
Eternities encapsulated in a tear.
Days of yore strangled in the cold, stark night,
Underneath the old tree, whispers of what was dear.

Embrace now the sorrow, the sweet of its pain,
For time, the cruel master, in regret will reign."

Each twinkling orb, joyous notes in a grand band,
Singing the vastness, of our great celestial stand.

My soul, alone drifts... in this infinite surrender."

Modernity emerges from the night,

Humbled remnant of a bygone day,

Shrouded in mystery, thou doth implore,
From ashes, let lost Glory rise once more.

Stood silent sentries, hushed by age vast,
Each beam did dance with swift romance’s light. 

Its shadowed streets kissed by the twilight’s grace,
Nestled in time's soft, unending fold.
A timeless ballad penned in architecture's trace,
In hallowed echoes, history’s tale is told.

Through fleeting years, its grandeur never shook,
Thus stands the city, like an open book."

Engorged on gilt and glory, worn like a shroud.
Its pomp belies the rot t’was built upon,
A hollow heart beneath the lustrous dawn.
Luxuriance masks tumultuous decay,
A tarnished crown, doomed to go astray.
What noble virtues it proclaimed so loud,
Reduced now to echoes in the cloud.
Her children steeped in vanity and strife,
Ink their vain opus in innocent life.
Its joy, a mirth that resonates with lies,
Beauty shadowed by predatory eyes.
Lo, witness from the ashes of mirth, a tale,

City old in age, but young in graceful score,
A relic of past, forever shall endure.
Living breath of history, in every stone core,
The echo of yesteryears forever to explore.

Etchings of men's toil, and love's dedication,
Unveiling life's vicissitudes, through each generation

Through vine-clad ruins, the shadows sway,
Eternal symbols of life's play.
Lost grandeur fades beneath the sun,

In quiet dignity, the remnants stand.
Remembering glory: a spectral sight,
Haunted whispers in the pale moonlight."

Glory ascends, like the morning sun,
In marble carved, victorious odyssey,
From distant dawn, to shadowed history.

Marking epochs of joy known only once,
Now trees bloom where lively markets were,
Time, the artist, renders beauty in every nuance.

Long faded, its lustre, yet the memory stays,
A phantom of magnificence in the dawn’s haze,

Echoes serenity in the eagle's cry."

Quiet sentinels of loss and recompense,
In silent sobriety, they wear."

Making crimson mischief upon the cerulean crest.

Sandcastles crumble, echoing the finality of yesterday.
Gulls weep goodbye in the fractured palate of twilight hues,
Lost in violet melody of surrender, yet sung in defiance of the approaching night."
844,43,serious,"In timeless blush of sunset's kiss, golden rays in ocean's tryst. The sea of splendor ebbs alight, in hues of heart, throbs twilight. Breathless beach in silence bows, to the brimming beauty, night endows. Dreams dust upon dusk's retreat, nightfall in sands, subtle and sweet."

Behold the drunken blush of twilight!"

Sea murmurs paint day’s smoky breath, farewell.
Whispering shadows dance - a spectral, silken run,

Soft whispers of light ripple through cerulean depths,
Love's fervent colors twine in the heart's scrolls.

Dusk, draped in pallor, creeps."

Oh, bask not in its silver plight,
Lies lurk beneath the moon's false light.

902,46,traditional,"In garden where the shadows mask the sun,
Blooms clashing truth in paradox, unsought:
The seed must die to live; its course begun,
In death, a vibrant life is newly wrought.

A candle's glow, to see, devours the light,
And rivers, though in haste, their end delays,
Content to shape the stone with gentle might,
In stillness, the grand mountains they portray.

Against this stage, man seeks his purpose too,
In paradox, an echo clear and stark:
In mittened frost, the fire of life burn anew,
And love illuminates when it grows dark.

In paradox, the world turns and prevails,
Unending truth in fleeting tales."

Echoes of thoughts entwined, resigned.
Wrong made right in fateful swoon,
Hope born from despair's lonely tune. 
Oh paradox, thou art the mystic's plight,
Twixt star-kissed dreams and stark daylight."
905,46,funny,"In truth's deceit, hawk's swift flight stands still,
Iron chains of freedom bind the willing fool,

In desert wasteland, silence holds the rule.

In solitude, a crowd does surely wait,
The dead of night, alive with twinkling cheer,
The coward's heart, a fearless hero's mate,
The end of all, yet ever drawing near.

In hunger's clutch, we feast on emptiness,
The deepest oceans, yet the shore is dry,
In sorrow's grin hides laughter’s recklessness,
The honest liar’s truth, an open lie.

Where less is more, still few understand."

Lost in found and wrong births right,
In solitude, we weave into the crowd.

Gathers more than gold in shifting sand.

A riddle dances, cloaked in day and night.
Paradox, thou cruel and gentle song,
Thou art where rights reside within the wrong.

What sorrow's found in joy's embrace so sweet,
And in defeat, a triumph tastes discreet.
Truth lies in lies, and echoes find their source,
A gentle ride, yet on a rampant horse.

To grasp thy form, we lose thy fleeting shape,
And face the freedom trapped within the drape.
Thus, paradox, thou art a puzzling hue,
Wherein the old gives birth unto the new."

In paradoxical dance, forever reign.
The sun's warm kiss gives birth to chilling rain,
Both the rose's bloom and its thorn, life does refresh. 
Mirth in sorrow's guise, and weeping cloaked in glee,
What fearful symmetry in chaotic peace,
We dwell in finite time, yet aim for eternity,
Building dreams on sand, expecting not to cease. 
Oh, this mirthful woe, this mournful ecstasy,
Paradox, thy name is life, thy evidence, our lease."

Bold vision blurred in shadows of stark light.
An echo’s silence roars; the mortal yoke,

Both loss and gain, our soul's eternal plight,
Defends a truth that lies within a joke.
The meek's brutal strength, the blind's keen sight,
The muted cry of silence when we spoke.

The serpent's bite and healer's antidote,
Love and hate both etched in heart's pure stroke.

In laughter hides a tear we fend.
A light so brief in dark's expanse,
Tis love in loss, in death, a dance.

In endings lie a dawn's rebirth.
A merry jest the heartbreak makes,
A paradox frames life’s true worth.

This riddle of our fleeting stir,
Bane yet balm in life's confer.
In thee lies joy, in thee, the dread,
Shall blossom fully once we’re dead."

Where rivers sing a melody divine.

In memory's vale, it gleams with kindled fire,
A faded portrait of yonder spire,
Reflects a sun that will not tire,
My heart, it aches with poignant desire.

To return to thee, my arcadia fair,
My soul does bleed in the cold, stale air.
O fleeting glimpse, O tender snare,
Of bygone days, none can compare. 

Longing fills my heart's abandoned space,
For that gentle place, I can't replace.

969,49,free,"Once dwelt in dale where songbirds chase,
A place of yore, lost now in haste.
Yearned my heart and found no solace,
In thoughts awash on time's vast waste.

Forsooth, my soul in sorrow laced,
Yet echoed still that joyous grace.
Though echoed still, 'twas but a trace,
A whisper on the morning's face.

A dream of yesteryears long past,
Too grand to hold, too sweet to last.
Now only in my dreams encased,
A place of peace, in memory cast.

Yet from my heart it won't be chased,
That longing for a lost home's taste."

Sighs in yonder's distant, spectral embrace.
Each trembling leaf, echoes of lost grace,
Pines for its lost identity in pace.

Ah, the poignant tears of the silent stones,
Chanting in the wind's sorrowful tones.
Beneath the moon, the dark river moans,
A dirge for meadows where daylight shone.

A ghost of laughter, a phantom's sigh,
In the wind's sweet lament, whispering nigh.
O' the melancholic birds in mid-flight cry,
Yearning for the dawn's vibrant dye.

Lonely mind, in absence's cold maze,
Forever longing for those halcyon days."
973,49,rational,"Beneath the ancient, whispering yew,
Lies memories cloaked in morning dew.
Long lost valleys, sunlit and fair,
My heart aches for their tranquil air.
Gone is the refuge, the quiet nest,
In distant dreams alone, it rests,
Enfolded in the heart's dim haze,
I pine, lost in illusions' maze.

The youthful meadows, the golden shore,
Exist in time's heart, forevermore.
Yet in my soul, the longing gains,
For homeland, absent, only remains.
Cling not to the ghosts of yore,
Long lost places breathe no more.

Lulled by the timeless river's serenade;
Aches my heart for that tranquil sphere,

Where day met night in soft twilight,
Where warbling thrush did sing, 
Its song of soaring golden wings.

Half lost in memory's mirthful maze,
Through the bleakness of endless days,
Even in the silent sorrow's drape,
The spirit seeks its tender escape. 

Longing for the past's face,
Eternal is the loss of place."

With solace treading the moss-covered streets.
Who’d whisper sly tales deep in mine ear,
Where have you vanished, sweet yesteryear?

Dreams of the past, like vapors they retreat,
Lost in the echoes of vacant, ghostly feet.
No laughter rings, no memory's feat,
Chilled are the stones where life's warmth once did seep.

Of youth now in the shadow's keep,
I yearn for the warmth of that meek retreat,
A longing echoes in heart's quiet peep,
For the lost haven where past and present meet."

A counterfeit of Day's routine.
Moon's mirage staged, a spectral show,
A parody of daylight's sheen.

Fioritura of twilight's blight,
To dark's dominion, we are akin.
Sickly sweet, the veil of night,
Holds sepulchral serenity within.

It feigns familiar, yet deceives,
An ominous death it strives to thwart.
Dorian dawn ever greets, and leaves;
Twilight, thou art but Escapist's art."

Betwixt the sun's departure, and moon's gain,
Soft hues of rouge and sable unite,
In ethereal ballads spun by the night.
A fleeting wisp of Vanishing light,
Beguiles the heart and charms the sight.
Time suspended in this twilight play,
Where Day's last kiss meets Night's soft sway,
Adieu we murmur to the waning day,
While dusk's enigma leads us astray.
In twilight's haunting beauty, lovers rest,
Enchanted by the horizon's painted chest.
Beneath the violet-blessed sky, we exist,
Bathed in the amethyst time-twist."

In silence sings a lullaby slight,
The spectral wonder, beloved Twilight."

Within the hollows, day submits to night.
Ghosts of sunlight fade in deep despair,
As chilling whispers meander the air.
Beguile the dusk, these Veiled Mysteries -
Silhouettes dance in twilight's histories. 
Each spectral shade, a story yet untold,
Of murmuring stars and secrets old.
As Darkness breathes its solemnity,
Echoes resonance of eternity.
In haunting grace, twilight conspires,
A spectral beauty softly tires.
Thus fades the day, in twilight's trance,
Bound in night's woeful romance."

Beneath a sphinx's enigmatic light.
Ghostly chariot of dusk eluding sight,

Velvet whisper, intimate and slight,
The haunting beauty - of twilight."

Twilight’s beauty, temporal trial.
Gilded edges of lost bright,
Echo the haunting, in twilight."

E'en in this shift, grace is sown,
Twilight mirrors life, brief and unknown."

Delighting in the uncharted sonatas of humanity's orchestra."

Bemuddled by feelings, enrobed in wonders,
Lost in the maze of love's blunder,

In our searing theorem of yearning, cloaked in twilight."

Wrestling with shadows of ephemeral truths,
The duality of man unraveled in quiet defiance,

through familiar eyes, unknowable spirits reveal.
How little we grasp, yet profoundly feel—
constant storms of love, sorrow, and zeal.
A trusted waltz of complex, human reel."

We dance, twirling, between hope and despair.
Love and indifference interchange roles,
Marrying the meek sheep with the lion's dare.
Each is but a song of a complex sphere,
Whispering in the ear of human nature.

Opaque as night, bright as midday bloom.
Unfathomable chasms to crystal shallows,

Through corridors of silent dreams, we echo.
The heart, an unsolved riddle in its shell,
In mirrors of others, our facets show.
Whence do we come, what mysteries we bear?
Our nature's riddle no string of words can share."

Mirth and mourning, discord and rhyme,

A symphony, in diversification— 
Such is man's creation."

Bare feet in paradox, both saint and sinner,

Ever torn, between the vessel and the void,

Our flaws embroider humans true.
In joy's light, shadows seek retreat,
All complexities embraced, beautifully sweet."

We live, elusive spirits cloaked in clay.
A dual realm is mankind's fickle heart,

A spectral House of gnarled splendor stands,
Its grandeur hints at better, bygone days,
Yet still a graveled charm, it wistfully commands.

Each pallid wall, a tome of whispered yore,
A crumbling sentinel 'gainst Death's cold hand,
In this lamented ruin, stark yet pure,
Reside the echoes of a loved lost land.

As Twilight, tender, wraps her inky shawl,
The House, forsaken, in still Beauty burns.
In haunted silence, stories seem to call,
As, like a Ghost, the world in orbit turns.

One elegy of stones and wind-blown prayer,
Glows soft within the heart, when one's not there."

Its splendor cloaked in cobwebs' ghostly sheen,

A Specter of its Past, it haunts the Night.
In its decay shines forth a haunted Light.
A Writer's Muse, a Poet's sweet Refrain,
Its walls whisper of Laughter, Love, and Pain.

Its beauty lies in faded Memories,
That echo still throughout its hollow knees."

Past echoes shrouded 'neath a cobweb's weave,

Grim sighs of empty rooms, forgotten plight,
A hollow beauty no one comprehends.
In eerie quiet, wisdom takes its flight,
And in its flight, a stark allure transcends.

Derelict in truth, yet rich as gold,
Disguised amidst the quiet and the dust;
A tale of life and time, unfurled and told,
Bestowed to rust, within the beauty thrust. 

Behold - the house, wide-eyed in decay,
In haunting charm, finds modern grace today."

At a rotting Structure’s vain vain.

Romance pretends in ghostly parlor's gloom,
Distant laughter lives in cobweb ballet,

For time may scar but memories are stayed,
In her decay, an elegance enhanced.

Windows, glass-less eyes, the world disown,

Yesteryear's laughter drowned in grief's release,
Echoes of life, erased by Time.

Each twinkling gem, by God's hand manifest,
Reflects on us, in far-off light engrossed.
In silence, hearts find what they yearn for most,
In the night."
1553,78,rational,"Beneath the shroud of velvet night,
Stars wink, in quiet splendor, bright.
Moonbeams whisper to the pines,
Clearly sung in pearly lines,
In the mirroring lake's light.

Their song, a hushed enchanting might,
Echoing beneath the shroud of velvet night.
Galaxies on black canvas paint,
An ethereal, dreamlike restraint,
Guarding slumber till dawn's first light,
Beneath the shroud of velvet night."
1554,78,profound,"Under the night sky's velvet shroud,
Star-kissed whispers call aloud.
In darkness, awe is re-endowed,
Under the night sky's velvet shroud.

Enigma lies far past the crowd,
In eternity strong and proud.
In Infinity, truth's allowed
Under the night sky's velvet shroud."
1555,78,superficial,"Beneath the veil of twilight's shy,
Beholds the diamond-studded sky,
A dance of lights, oh what a sight,
In the kingdom of the night.
Reflections of a cosmic cry,
In the beauty of a night sky."
1556,78,expressive,"Beneath the cloak of velvet night I sigh,  
Star-scattered canvas of the silent high.
Questions birthed in whispering constellations float,  
Mirrored in wonder of a poet's note.  
Oh, such beauty in the night doth lie."
1557,78,restrained,"Stars in the velvet silk, whispering shy,
Rivulets of light, in the quiet night sky.
Gazing up, the painter's sight,
Chasing the beauty of the night.
Smilies hidden in the rye,
Telling tales in the night sky."
1558,78,happy,"Stars cap the night with a twinkling glow,
In Frost's whispering style, they speak so low.
Dancing in unison, a cosmic ballet show,
Stars cap the night with a twinkling glow.
Under this sky, happiness blooms and grows,
Sparkling tales the moon does throw.
Stars cap the night with a twinkling glow,
In Frost's whispering style, they speak so low."
1559,78,sad,"Underneath the night’s dark shroud, stars sigh,
Tears of muted light fall from the sky.
Lost dreams that once were boldly soughed,
In the abyss, now coldly caught.
In quiet sorrow, stars weep and sigh, 'neath the night’s dark shroud."
