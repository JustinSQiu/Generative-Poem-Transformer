In every turn reveals its might,
A passion formed in moon's pale light.

Dread tempests roar, sweet breezes hail,
Courageous bound 'gainst stormy fight,
In twilight's gray and morning's bright.

In beauty awed, in terror's sight,
Beckoned by the majestic right."

Dreamed secrets to the curious bay,
Heart's freedom found 'neath azure veil,
Love's whispers ride on tempest's gale.

Oceans vast, in starlight dressed,
Cradle dreams in cool, deep chest.
Eclipse the sun, yet shine so bright,
Modern chaos hides in night.

An empire deep, beneath the sky,
Where ancient silence does rely.
Stained with tears, yet carved in joy;
In every depth, life's bold employ.

Infinite realm, beguiling, wild,
Soothes the man, awes the child.
A cutting edge, a soothing song,
In the ocean, we belong."

Transcending heaven's whispered dirge.
Sea passion's ardor bears his soul,
A tempest in the deepest shoal.

In salt and brine, truth unfurl,
Each crest a fleeting, glassy pearl.
His spirit forged in the ocean's song,
In its depths, he truly belongs.

To the crashing waves, his soul transfused. 

Sorrow drowned in the sea's embrace,
Joy reborn in its vast, open space. 
In the ocean's arms, his solace waits,
Baptized anew in destiny's fates. 

Please note: The poet Lord Byron is known for his expressive Romantic verse rather than the brevity and precise structure of haiku. This poem maintains the spirit of Byron along with the thematic focus on the ocean but does not strictly adhere to the haiku form. Haiku poetry traditionally consists of three lines and 17 syllables, divided into a 5-7-5 syllable count."

Lovers joined till dawn's might,
In silence of the night."
67,3,cynical,"Sea's dreadful allure,
Deceives hearts with false echoes.
Fool's paradise, sure. 

Beneath venomous waves,

Love's grave, the ocean's hollow caves,
Nothing's as it seems. 

Deceit in each ripple,
Sea's a cruel tale's scripture."
68,3,rhythmic,"Beneath moon's silver gleam, it stirs,
Infinite depths of azure blur.
The ocean, vast, in silence roars,
Crashing on far and pearl-sand shores.

Mystic song in twilight sung,
A siren's heart forever wrung."

Untamed, it's rife, free.

Waves, an endless dance,
Under moonlight's soft romance.

In dreams, an ocean stirs, boundless, feral.
Sweet terror whispers, 'gainst waves that crash.

Roars silence, in depths where secrets perish,
Where oblivion dances, shadows flourish,
The cruel sea's embrace, life cherish.

Stars mirrored on the surface serene,
Yet beneath, serpents lurk unseen.
Beware, O Love, the ocean's cataclyne.

Each whispered wave, a mournful tale,
Of ships consumed, of hearts that fail,
A siren song singing the ocean's male.

Thus, mortals learn in dread and awe,
Of mysteries held in the ocean's maw,
The whispers of the wild, dark, sea-scape raw."

Our secrets, the ocean keeps,
In eternal, azure, deep."

Each surge a realm of secrets,

She roars a timeless, haunting knell.
Her waves, fierce knights in endless fight,
Storming the earth in moon's pale light.

O, ocean wild with passions yearn, 
To your enigmatic song we return."

Breaths of the sea's timeless rhyme.

Solitude in blue serene.
Sea's heart, evergreen."

Enraptured by Day's gentle flight.
Frothy lace on skin so bright,
Shimmering in the lunar light.

A merry dance on Ocean's floor.
Waves caress the sandy shore,
Songs of joy forevermore,
In her depths, my soul shall soar."
79,3,sad,"In moonlight's pale, lorn embrace,
The sea weeps waves of silent woe. 
Dreams lost in her depth's cold space.

Tales of love drowned, without trace,
In abyss where no sunbeam glow.
Hidden beneath surface, no grace.

Feasting on sorrow's subtle taste,
In her heart, endless shadows grow.
Ocean's lament, Lord Byron's chaste.

Lonely tears by the night replaced,
Her sad serenade, muted low.
A melancholy beauty, chased.

Cruel sea, with bitter paste,
Paints a portrait of echoed thro'w.
Her sorrow deeper, left in haste. 

An ode to ocean's vast waist,
In mournful strains, the waters flow.
Her pain in brine, forever encased."

Silhouetted trees bow low, their strength quietly spent.
Snowflakes fall like whispered secrets, fresh modern intent.
In city's heart, steel towers weep under winter's event.

Through Earth’s cold lips, speaks summer’s sweet lament.
Yet, in this fall, a majesty renewed,
In the transient beauty of descent.

Resigned to winter's serenade, they stand,

God's artistry, in mortal realm displayed,

In subtle hues of red and gold, a tapestry's born,
Marking change, as days unfold, 'fore Winter's scorn.
Mirthful Autumn, in its hold, plays the reaper’s horn,
Ringing echoes, ethereal, from dusk till morn. 

Yet within this quiet death, rebirth takes its stance,
Seeds lie dormant, hold their breath, for Spring's romance.
Thus, through Autumn's muted breath, reveals life's dauntless dance,

Eternal dance twixt bloom and silent sleep.

Silent hymn she sings in the choral wind,
A gentle invitation to begin again;
Promising, in the fall, there's no true end,
That echoes the Master's original plan.

In her twilight hour, see, a radiant crown!
Her reign ends not with decay, but pure renown.
In sweet surrender, life reclines,

In rapture we do glean the harvest done.
Sweet season’s face shows no ruthless mien,

Fruitful bough leans low, its burden won.
Nature's grandeur stirs the soul’s coffer,

510,25,intense,"In silent whispers, shadowed town lay bare,
A ghost of bustling days, tainted with despair.
Kin of time, scorned by lunar slant,
Desolate, no echoes chant.
Pavement cracks hold tales untold,
Of dreams lost and youth grown old.
This town, remembered not, lies eerie still,
Haunted by the past's relentless chill."
511,25,relaxed,"An afternoon sun bathes the silent town's shell,
Shadows stretch, remembering stories to tell.
Once lively corners are now ghosts, but I see,
In vacant shops, life’s echo, whispered faithfully. 
Buried hope, lurks beneath the clocktower bell.
Streets hum Eliot's tales, only Time can quell."
512,25,emotional,"In shadows dost forgotten town recline,
Now desolate as early morning’s frost.
Echoes of mirth, where spectral suns declined,
In silent streets where ghosts of love are lost.
Yet, dreams remain, though all else be decayed,
In sleep-wrapped quiet, memories take flight.
Past joys are glimpsed in spectral arcade,
Imprinted deep in haunted hues of night.
Withering lives, in twilight's pall displayed,
Each echo mourns the death of dying light.
Whence joy departs, in sorrow's arms we fade, 
In death's embrace, once shining town's long night. 
So, truth unfolds in ruins left untold, 
Dusk’s echo speaks—its silence, oh so bold."
513,25,rational,"In silence, the echoes tread under spectral gloam,
A town forgotten, where once vibrant life hath bloom.
Shrouded in hush, shadows in the sunk dome,
Seeking solace in lost time's ineffable tomb. 

Cobbled lanes weave like pale, labyrinthine wake,
Whispers cling to ancient brick in wistful lament,
All shall remain, the dusk kiss of heartache,
Eternal is the dance of absence and sentiment. 

Yet , in its heartache awakens the sublime,
Echoes of lives lived, etched on time's pallid face,
A forgotten town, enduring the test of time,
In the silent song of the past's embrace."
514,25,profound,"Lost echoes sing of towns forgotten, lives elapsed,
In crumbling stone, silence tasted, undisturbed.
Each faded facade whispers history, garlands lap'd.
In forsaken dreams, quietly echoes are perturbed.

The clock halted, time in dusty shrouds enwrapped,
Lives lived, unremembered, souls unstirred.
Time’s subtle thief has all memory zapped,
In forgotten whispers, lost words unheard.

Yet in this void, of what was, is a beauty,
In the decay, the formless, transcendent murmur.
The forgotten town sings of life, its eternal duty,
Echoing the poetry of existence, the soft purrer.

From faded pasts catastrophic loss is begotten,
Yet find we peace and solace in the limbs of the forgotten."
515,25,superficial,"Lost in time’s surreptitious shroud, that town,
Eliot’s whisper echoes 'round its walls.
Ghosts in shadows, unremembered, downed,
Receding sun, on stale stones, softly falls.
Its name in dust, for memory's surface, too small.

Lost echoes of laughter, an abandoned sound.
Grace in decay, in silence profound,

Whispers of yesterday, in a forgotten town."

A town unremembered, in hollows reclines.
The moon weeps for stories, an echo of cries,
In shadow, it dreams, under watchful skies.
In pale strangeness, it sleeps, where oblivity dines."
518,25,happy,"In yonder town, where time forgot, a dance,
Underneath the eternal sun's entrance.
Laughter, like the river, flows all around,
Echoing, an ethereal sound.
Even twilights gleam with mirth profound,
Never a frown in this hallowed ground."
519,25,sad,"In shadowed silence, lost to time’s decree,
A forlorn hamlet sighs, bereft of song.
Its echoes murmur tales of used-to-be,

Hope’s final vestiges drift away, consume."

The marigold sun dips, our hearts bereaved,
In solitude, we mourn lost certainties.
An enduring goodbye, in Marquez's verse,
Beneath love's cloak, we disperse."

Under the sorrow-stricken skies.
Hands held a moment, then apart,
In the tangle of a heavy heart.
A last dance, a teardrop baptized,
So lies the tale of our last goodbyes."

A dance of shadows, our last goodbyes.
Lives entwined in love's sweet sorrow,
Parted by the morrow's arrow.
In silence, dear, we reap what we sow,
In memory's garden, our love shall grow."
1183,59,modern,"Beneath neon lights, we wore silence sublime,
Our whispers, ghosts of a cobalt-chrome time.
A hushed kiss, tender as falling rime,
Born of love, etched in the city's grime.
Our last goodbye, a wordless rhyme,
In the cathedral of midnight's chime."

Voices echoing last goodbyes. 
Our hands, once clasped, now ghost echoes, 
In the sob of lonely skies. 
Chasing sunsets, where love dies, 
In the realm of closed eyes."

A parrot squawked, “Do not offend!”
Two lovers smirked, in time suspend,

Chuckles echoed, parting trend,
In Marquez's world, goodbyes extend."
1186,59,romantic,"In last breaths, in twilight’s hush,
Two souls conversed, but not with words.
In every glance, in whispers’ blush,
Their love painted in celestial verbs. 
One last touch, a whispered adieu,
Farewell to love, timeless and true."
1187,59,cynical,"In echoing halls where love once danced,
Fickle hearts, in their final stance.
Stern faces hide, tears unwept,
Bitter is the goodbye kept.
Reluctant moon weeps, stars glance,
Forever lost, our last romance.
Thus ends life's cynical tryst,
In goodbye's cold, remorseless mist."

Lonely echoes past, love's last sight.

Harvest of heart, a fading quiet."

Echoes dance, whispers circle, in Marquez's mystic sky,
Eternal threads of existence weft, in last goodbyes."

A symphony of tears under a muted sky.
Beneath the sorrow, love's ember lies,
A tragic ballad, where destiny complies.
Oh, embrace the pain, let mournful eyes dry,
In every farewell, a world may die."
1191,59,relaxed,"Beneath the copious emerald sky,
We murmured our last goodbyes.
No tears in the eye, nor sorrow's sigh,
Just whimsical smiles, as time flies.
Love, gentle as a lullaby,
A memory never dies. 
As the moon cast its silver guise,
We breathed our final goodbye."
1192,59,emotional,"In Marquez's voice, a tale unfolds,
Two souls adrift, love story told.
Unraveling in time's charade,
Last goodbye in twilight fade.
Book of hearts forever closed,
Whispered words in sorrow posed,
Ending echoes in the glade,
Last goodbye, our serenade."

Two hearts whispered a final goodbye,
Tales of love, heavy with sighs.
Eternity wept, in their love's demise,
Unsaid words in the exotic Marquez guise,
Echoed the saddest of last goodbyes."

Lived a sigh, a memory and two parted streams.
Laughter echoed in silhouettes, love in shadowed eyes,
Bound by whispered promises; a dance of last goodbyes."
1195,59,superficial,"Adios tender, light as a feather's trace,
In Marquez's style, weaving lace.
In echoed sighs, our last embrace,
A ballad sung in fleeting pace.
Words unspoken, secrets wane,
In fifty heartbeats, ends the refrain,
Goodbye like rain, goodbye in vain,
A superficial, soft refrain."
1196,59,expressive,"In time's old heart, our affections twine,
Ageless whispers 'gainst death's design.
A waltz of souls, intertwining still,
As we bow, to the final thrill.
Echoes of laughter, now echoes of sighs,
Under the saddened sky, our last goodbyes."
1197,59,restrained,"Once while dawn set in the love-drunk skies,
we exchanged spoken tender goodbyes.
Our hands apart in fatal losses,
Shared sorrow hung on crooked crosses,
In soft whispers, love beneath lies—
Buried deep in the pang—last goodbyes."

Two hearts, in twilight, not old.
Bidding adieu, eyes alight,
Under the canopy of starlight.
In goodbyes, joy retraced,
No sorrow embraced.
Just love whispered, enclosed,
Epoch sealed, grandly composed."
1199,59,sad,"In shadows deep of endless night,

On this quiet, blessed night.
Moonlight casts, in silver glow,
Secrets that the darkness know.
Shadows waver, dance on sight,

Hidden stars, in veiled delight,
Find solace in the noble night.
In tranquil dreams, the lullaby flow,
Of this quiet, blessed night.

Under sleeping skies, sunk in milky light,
In gentle hush, the world is right.
In softened whispers wings take flight,
On this quiet, blessed night."

Empty squares, in whispers show,
Monoliths sighing low.

Night inhales, city exhales slow."

Gossamer wisps of pale moonlight.

Existence caught in ghostly flight,
Embracing void, forsaking light,
Forever bound in quiet night."

Kafka’s bug, sans human fright
In glow worm tutu yellow.

Veiled in silence as Kafka's realm transcends.
Unified under the moon's romantic trance,
In intimacy, together they dance.

In the quiet night, two shadows blend."

Quiet shroud of night unseen,
Echoes glide like eyes in dream."

Shadow puppets dance, as reality fades.
Light meekly threaded through the sleeping yawn,
In the veiled silence.

Quietude’s ballet in the dreamscape wades,
Hours unwinding, 'til a timid dawn,
An echo within the solemn glades.

In our dreams, the waking world is pawned-
Yet, seek not to shackle what silence aids,
In the veiled silence of the night so drawn,
In the veiled silence."

Solitude's whispers echo in plight.
Dimension of shadow, moon's soft slight,
Mirrors of mind veiled in self-fight.
Lost between the silence, starlight,

Opaque truths held in contradictory light,
Existence imbued with Kafkaesque fright.
Fear in familiar, cold so white,
Within each heart a solitary night,
Underneath the veil of quiet night."

Fragile whispers the wind bestow.
Dreams deep within mysteries sew,

Peace, unto this world bestow,
Under the moon's ethereal brow,
Quiet night, an calm lantern's glow."

Watching, silent in their flight.
Kafka dreamed, so it seemed,
Of solitude from man redeemed.

Low murmur of the distant light,

Men asleep, secrets keep,
Only stars, their vigil keep.

Quiet night, last respite."

Nestled in veil's ubiquity,
Masked in starless tranquility.

Eclipsed by shadow's lullaby,
In quiet night of hushed decree.

A brooding calm - world's filigree,
Taut silence sets existence free,
In quiet night, in quiet sigh."

In ether's gentle, hushed recite,
We find our solace, in quiet night."

Clanging rides, laughter caught in flight.

Funhouse mirror's jest,
In waltzing splendor, candy-vest.

Ferris wheel spins again."

Jazz-age wonder, lights blazed,
Swaying echoes of laughter's phase,
Inebriated by the vibrant maze,

Lost in revel,
Spirits soar ethereal,

Danced upon dreams, now cast to the wind.
Echoes of laughter, locked in twilight's bars,

Enshrined in sorrow, love's emblem is lost,
Within the heart's hollow, lies the frost.
A candle dimmed in love's tempest tossed,
A sweet serenade to the love we've crossed.

Each day I walk this desolate shore,
Imprisoned by longing, forevermore.
In wistful silence, your name I adore,
Yet, our song of love, sings no more.

Thus, love lost leaves but a haunting toll,
Etched in the theater of my soul."
1261,63,informal,"Once lay our hearts entwined, sweet and soft,
Now distant seas part us, aloft.
Words whispered 'neath the moon's gaze,

Regret’s the only kiss I’ve got,
In memory of a love, forgot."

Beneath the moon’s soft, silver stare.
Now only echoes fill the night,

Vows whispered in the hushing breeze,
Float with ease amongst the trees,
Yet through the pain, the heart concedes,
Love's imprint forever bleeds.

Lost in time, yet etched so deep,
In dreams of her, I wake and weep.
Oh mournful joy, oh bittersweet,
In love lost, in death we meet."

In secret whispers, hearts' clandestine delight.
Now your echo fades, in the sighing trees,
A specter dwelling in the moon's soft light.

Our love, once fervent as the summer sun,
Now resides in the realm of forgotten lore.
Yet, ev'ry sunset weeps, the day is done,
For the lost amour, that is no more.

Surrounded by silence, I can but miss,
The love that once painted my life's canvas bright.
Tears are the ink, your memory the abyss,
A love lost in the fickleness of night."

Now, alone I tumble, bereft of sight.
Our love, no more, like old cheese gone rotten, 
Moldy memories, dearth of what's forgotten. 
Spell of laughter, cure for my sad plight."
1266,63,romantic,"Beneath the hush of moon’s soft-glowing light,
Two hearts danced as one, then fell apart.
Our song is hushed, drowned in silent night,
Years can’t erase your imprint on my heart.

In dreams, love’s echo stirs the quiet air,
Though hands no longer touch, eyes no longer meet.
Love, once so tangible, now a mere prayer,
Yet boundless in absence, bitter yet sweet.

Inautumn’s sigh and summer's golden hue,
Remnants of our love persist.
Love lost, yet in each season I find you,
In every sunset’s tender, tryst.

Thus, with each dawn, I love and lose anew,  
In heart's deep recesses, I always find you."

In sweet silence, we yielded our sparks.
A fool's folly, this heart's bitter cost,
In cold empties, still echoes of past.
Yet it's clear, love lost is life's cruel art."
1268,63,rhythmic,"Our love, once bright as morning's gleam,
Now drowned in shadows of regret;
Like whispers lost in dream's sweet stream,
A melody our hearts forget.

In silence, echoes of our song,
In tears, a drifting sigh.
In absence, where our souls belong,
In love, we said goodbye."
1269,63,free,"Beneath the willow's mournful sighs, we were,
Promise of endless love whispered to star.
Yet, destiny's cruel winds did our hearts mar, 
Fate's cold hands tore our entwined souls asunder. 

In the mirror of tears, see your face blur,
A love lost, remains in shards, a painful scar.
Remnants of our dreams, scattered near and far,
Now only echoes of laughter occur. 

Yet, within this ache, find no cause to curse,
For the love we birthed, none can disperse.
Every memory etched, heart's immortal verse,
Though the road we tread turned tragically terse.

In the night, still, our love softly converse,
A symphony of sorrow in universe."
1270,63,intense,"In our love's flash, like summer's lightning squall,
Two hearts converged, then torn apart by fate.
Your echo lingers in each silent hall,
A testament to passion turned to hate.

Oh, how we danced in love's ephemeral glow,
Yet shadows crept over our sunset's light.
Behold, a garden where love ceased to grow,
In silence does mourn the day's gentle night.

From passion's peak to depths of despair,
A symphony of love turned elegy.
No more in your eyes, that tender care,
Lost in the tumult of love's tragedy.

Yet in my heart, your memory stays,
A lingering ghost of our love-drenched days."
1271,63,relaxed,"Upon a moonlit shore, love's echo fades,
Like crimson hues dissolve at dusk’s arrival.
When hands once held let go, the warmth decays,
Yet in the heart, her ghost keeps love's survival.
Through loss, we learn to cherish love’s sweet rival."
1272,63,emotional,"In dusk's caress, we dreamt of love's soft light,
Now vanished as the stars once in our heart.
Our whispers lost, engulfed in endless night,
Where love once bloomed, now stands a barren part.

We danced with joy, 'neath moon's romantic glow,
Our souls entwined, a tale of passion's might.
Yet love's sweet song fell silent, now we know,
The echo of its melody takes flight.

Tears fall as petals, memories of a rose,
The scent of love remains, but love -- no more.
In sorrow's arms, our grieved hearts repose,
A testament to love we held before.

Though parted, still in phantom's grasp, we're lost,
Our love remains, a ghost at winter's frost."

Love's fervor, bright as constellations lost.
Yet, 'twas not meant, fate's line would not align,
In star-crossed gaps, our ardor paid the cost.

Rimmed tears declare a love that time did toss,
Their silent echo, both cruel and kind.
Our story ends, a narrative of loss,
In love's sweet ache, you ever roam my mind.

Fair love lost, like whispers in the wind,
Yet in heart's cradle, memory does bind.
Reflecting on a flame that did rescind,
In the mirror of the soul, love's footprint, signed. 

Though your absence pangs, an echo quite austere,
In your lost love, my heart holds you near."

Sunken now in deep twilight's dread.
In her eyes, no longer sparkled light,

Ghosts of us, in silent abyss.
Love, once blooming in shades of green,
Lost in autumn's cold, merciless bliss.

Eternal love, now a phantom smart,
In the ruins of our desolate heart."

Faded now, the hues of passion's song.

Unseen, unheard - our symphony swan,
Lost in the melody of love's wrong."

Lost love, like fragile petals, blown away.
Embers of passion, spent and hollow,
In hearts, once aflame, now ashen grey.

Eyes that beheld our tender past,
In pain, decline to meet the morrow.
Alas, sweet love, didn't last,
Bleeds silence, echoes of our shared sorrow.

A lonely shore, where love's sun set,
Kissed dreams goodbye, with tear's wretched borrow.
In memories’ mirror, our silhouette,
A love lost to life's cruel arrow."
1277,63,restrained,"Beneath the pallor of surrender’s light,
Two hearts once fused in fiery love's embrace.

A phantom dance of a love we lost."
1278,63,happy,"Upon distant stars, our love's soft sorrow we toss,
Yet wrapped in loss, joy we found, not sadness.
For though we parted, no ire did it cost,
In heartbreak, a strange, contented gladness. 

Echoes of laughter, mid autumn's harvest,
In shared memories smiled, not a farce.
Love lost, yet no tears, our passions rest,
A waltz that ended, but still plays in the heart's harp.

A chapter concluded, no tale overthrown,
From love’s sweet whispers, blossoms friendship's speech.
In this fond farewell, seeds of growth were sown,
Each to their own path, yet never out of reach.

In loss, we found a love that will not cease,
A story ended, in love's sweetest release."
1279,63,sad,"Once love was fertile as the spring's embrace,
As radiant as a morning's golden light,

A love untamed and wild, now torn apart."

In the still marsh, side-by-side.
‘Neath the half-moon's lonesome cry,
Twilight whispers, daytime's nigh—
Gentle dusk, in purples sigh.

Shadows weep in hushed detail.
Daylight yields, with fading light,

'Neath twilight's solemn veil, at dusk,
Life slows in resplendent husk.
In quiet strains, day takes flight,
Yielding to velvet night.

Pray, repeat this story hushed,
At dusk, 'neath twilight's solemn veil.
Softly surrender day's harsh fight,
Embrace tender the night."
1343,67,modern,"At dusk, our thoughts are drawn asunder,
Beneath the city's neon blunder.
Windows reveal the day's surrender,
On solitary hearts, so tender.

Each nightfall, an offering tender,
At dusk, our thoughts are drawn asunder."

Posing like coy coyotes, playing tricks.
Through twilight’s veil, o'er hill and dale they seek,
At dusky time, the stars emerge so slick.

Night owls in jest, an odd romantic pick,
Woo shadows, practicing their lunatic clicks.
Day too, bewitched, gives in to antic's shtick,
At dusky time, the stars emerge so quick."
1346,67,romantic,"At dusk, the flame of day resigns,
Where whispers tread the hush of dreams,
Beneath the veil of twilight seams,
Her tender touch in shadow aligns.

Upon the moor, a starlight pines,
Charmed under tranquil nightfall themes,
At dusk, the flame of day resigns.

Eclipsed by moon, her love entwines,
In silence, speaking more than seems, 
Her heart, a whisper ‘mid the streams,
Effaced in tender night, reclines.
At dusk, the flame of day resigns."

Life and light it yearns to flee.
Shadows extend their wicked hand,

Sealed secrets in the shadows stashed.
Revealed in love's lamenting woe,

Stirs subtle heartache, calm yet musk,
Memoirs of love, through time's soft brush.
Under stars' glow, as day recedes,
Beneath the dimming sky of dusk.

In this still silence, no rebuke,
In nightly charm, spirits rebuffed.
Bound by the softest of night's beads,

Beneath the silver shroud of stars she sighs.
As day to dreamy twilight must comply,
And under darkling vault, the sun's strength lies.

A hushed and sacred hymn to night, she cries,
Dusk's gentle hand doth close the daylight’s eye.
Amidst the whispered secrets that she spies,
The world in hazy beauty turns to lie.

In her, all dreams might advance,
Nightfall's secrets to entrance.
In twilight's soft and silent trance,
Dusk's shadows spread a velvet stance."

Evening tears drop as stars gleam in detail,
A mesmerizing sight nature has bred.

As twilight kisses goodbye, moonlight led,
Dusk paints the sky in hues of rosy red."

Beneath the mournful yew, he softly sings.
A twilight lullaby, as day escapes,
In whispered hush, the evening landscape shapes.

The hills cast long their fading, wistful rings,
At dusk, the crow descends, to rest his wings.
Shadowy spectres stir in moor's embrace,
As darkness weaves in threads of silent grace.

To twilight's tune, he finds where quiet clings,
At dusk, the crow descends, to rest his wings."

Untold secrets it unveils,
In each star that sails,
A canvas born of love’s pure sight.

At dusk, the sky weaves tales of delight."

Quietly cloaks the day, in sorrow's sway.
Gone, the light, in somber fade, betrays,
Echoes the silence, in poignant displays.

Beneath the twilight, shadows grow,
Dusk's soft shroud, a mournful veil of gray.
Tears of day, in dew drops flow,
Upon the silent earth, in dismay.

Stars flicker, in heaven's sorrowful play,
Yet, their glow, seems faint, faraway.
Life's fleeting light, in sunset's array,
Dusk's soft shroud, a mournful veil of gray."

A rugged song, a soul's reply,
Bound to earth, yet born to fly."
