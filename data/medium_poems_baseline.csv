A sentinel bold, in weathered delight.

Held by the moon, he radiates bright,
His tale is weaved in celestial loom.
Bathing in a sea of starry light.

A bastion of hope, standing upright,
In his silence, tales of joy resume.
A sentinel bold, in weathered delight,

He whispers stories of sailors, their brave fight,
Of Sun's farewell, and Moon's soft perfume,
Bathing in a sea of starry light.

In life's tempest, he's the sturdy knight,
Present always, his love to consume.
A sentinel bold, in weathered delight,
Bathing in a sea of starry light."

Its beam faded, in the grief incurred,

Revisiting echoes of waves, unheard;
An old lighthouse stands, against time's relentless hand.

Birthed in hope, life’s flickered strand,
Deserted, swallowed by years, blurred,
Into shadows, where once it grandly spanned.

In quiet despair, it mourns the planned,
Weeping dreams into the undisturbed,
An old lighthouse stands, against time's relentless hand,

Ghostly sentinel of forsaken land,
Keeping watch over the absurd,
Into shadows, where once it grandly spanned.

Grief lingers, a tale unbanned,
Embodying the sorrow absurd,
An old lighthouse stands, against time's relentless hand,
Into shadows, where once it grandly spanned.

In lands forgotten, where war’s seeds are sowed,
They bear their wounds, not outward, but inside.

In chilling silence, they've traded life for fight,
Their dreams of home, mere ghosts in smoke’s bleak trail.
Through haunted days and endless, death-cold night,

Night's dark, knotted with sacrifice, his guiding light.

Blood stains innocence, sinking deep in earth's embrace,
Love’s lament blooms in his empty place.
Head held high, towards destiny he raced,
No surrender, in death's cold, austere space.

Hero's song unsung in dawn’s quiet sighs,
Honour carved deep in the endless skies.
Pain and beauty in a world confound,
In the bravery of silence, heroes are found.

Gone life’s delight, he knows only despair,
Braving the night, a sacrifice to bear.

Upon death's field, his young dreams he bequeath,
For love of land, he greets the grinning wreath.
His world undone, by a bullet's cold sheath,
Yet, unafraid, he enters the long sleep.

War's cruel hand, steals away his delight,
Yet in this stand, shines his brave soul so bright.
His final breath, a testament of might,

One life ends, so others may see the dawn,

But let not humor mar brave sacrifice,

Fate's harsh decree beckoning from afar.
In trenches deep, with Heaven's gaze above,
Sworn to still dawn with courage as his star.

Braving hell's song, he bore his banner high,
In the throes of war, holding forth a dream.
Sacrifice, his gift under a foreign sky,
Love's echo his only requiem stream.

Ebon night wept, its tears kissed hallowed ground,
Silencing his beating heart, ere pure and brave.
Yet in his fall, a tender love he'd found,
In her heart, their love's sanctuary he gave.

Courage unwept, his breath holds no remorse,
Freedom's cost paid willingly in each course.
To fields of red, his youth he must consign,
In gas and lead, where poppies intertwine.
His duty held, where life and love detour,
A tale retold, in stone of cenotaur.
Veins run dry, in Flanders' hallowed sleep,
His echo sighs with promises he'd keep.

In sacrifice, he found his truest fight.
For freedom’s pledge, we owe our deepest debt,
In honour of the soldier’s silhouette."

Steel-heart, echo mired in no-man's land,

A sacrifice so bitter, hard to withstand.

Hope's bloom in smoke-choked trenches sadly cease,
His duty's path by machine-gun fire crossed.
Through tear-gas-talons, seeks he elusive peace,
All dreams prematurely eternally lost.

From home's bountiful joy, ripped cruelly apart,
A chiaroscuro of lost innocence.
Each bullet seeks, and rips asunder heart,
Bare witness to mankind's unthinking sense.

He falls, in mud his final bed bestown,
Silent tribute to a world he scarcely known."
271,13,relaxed,"Beneath the stars, the soldier walks in dreams,

Beyond the call of duty finds his fate.
For love of land, surrenders precious life,
Upon war's sacrilegious, crimson slate.

In dreams, his echoing cries resound,
In silent screams of pain, unseen, unheard.
His body lies in foreign, cold, damp ground,
Yet spirit soars, like a freely flying bird.

A living ghost, he wanders through our hearts,
His sacrifice a testament of pain.
His memory a beacon as time parts,
A soldier's loss, but freedom's gain.

So, through the pain, emerges something bright,
A soldier's death ignites the flame of right."

Courage cloaked in shadows of despair.

No crimson cross, just iron's icy glare.

Fighting, falling, in that fickle fray,
No laurels of his lease but sorrow's seed.
Painting peace with crimson life's array,
His youth a pyre for freedom's fervent creed.

Within this world, unwept, he breathes his last,
The bitter cost of victory in view.
A bonded, bloodied brother to headfast,
Poignant sacrifice, eternally imbued.

Oh, mourn the brave who slumber in the soil,
Their lives the price of liberty's great coil."

For a soldier falls not beneath the blade,
But within the shadow of promises unmade.

For home’s sweet harmony, he yearned the deep.
His gift of peace, in love’s encircling sweep,
A tale of valor, kindled beyond the grave.

His eyes mirrored a thousand dawns awake,
In laughter’s echo, he found solace steep.
From battles’ song, he chose love’s notes to leap,
O'er borders drawn by man, a bridge to make.

His sacrifice, a symphony of light,
A testament of joy in courage’s name.
His spirit danced in freedom's heartfelt game,
Illuminating dark, a beacon bright.

No tears for him, but laughter’s tender praise,
A soldier's light, forever love shall raise."

Cries of society, once dissonant, scattered far and wide,
Now in unity, echo through silicon valleys,
Technology, you are the shimmering tide,
A beacon amidst life's endless galleys.

You rise, like diligently soldered circuit, destiny's trusted ally,
Embedding yourself in lines abstract and undefined.
Bare feet of connection, you bravely defy distance’s sigh,
Your whispering screen, a solace for the confined.

Vibration of discord, you transmuted to harmonic pulse,
A single touch, now a worldly embrace,
For invisible strings you assemble, a network to convulse,
Oh, technology, in your dance, traces of humanity we trace.

In the hum of your existence, we thrive, we evolve,
Yet must we not forget the pen that once did solve,
The silken threads of thought, so direct, so raw,
Neither binary nor coded, a simple yet profound law.

PANTOUM OF NOSTALGIA

Old streets whisper sweet poetry of time,
The dust we tread are memories sublime.
Aching heart longs for a yesterday,
Reminds us of innocence, minutes away.

The dust we tread are memories sublime,
Lost in the bloom of the fleeting time.
Reminds us of innocence, minutes away,
Shadows of past, touch of a kinder day.

Aching heart longs for a yesterday,
Shadows of past, touch of a kinder day,
Old streets whisper sweet poetry of time."
281,14,informal,"Ode to Tech in Angelou Take 

Oh how we weave, humans akin,
To tarantulas spinning webs thin.
Constrained no more by nature's whim,
We draw shapes of silicon kin.

From glass towers to mobile wonder,
Connected asunder, our minds blunder.
Where once we'd dream shards of thunder,
Now we look, tweet, swipe in surrender.

Yet behold the gift of light and sound,
Conversating with lost souls found.
Our words flying earthbound,
In binary digits growth is profound.

Dictator or savior, hard to cast,
In technology's multifaceted blast.
An ode to it, through centuries vast,
May its path not befall us aghast.

Old toys sleep in forgotten dust,
Echoes of laughter have left and gone,
Cloaked in the cover of age and rust.
The days of youth no longer dawn.

Echoes of laughter have left and gone,
Polaroids faded, songs unsung.

In the stillness of the night, in the tranquility of dawn,
Mired in thought, we succumb to the touch of keys.
No parchment, no quill, no postman’s yawning drawn,
Just alight fingers dancing in digital ease.

Oh, the dance of creativity borne of pixels, not ink,
You, Digital Orpheus, play not on lute but console.
Imagination not confined 'twixt book’s hard brink,
The ether its vast parchment, the story told in whole.

We say goodbye to the age of tireless scribes,
Hello to lightning speed of digital tribes,
The legacy of dreams we so care encode,
To this modern marvel, a luminous ode.

Pantomime of Yesterday (Pantoum)

Nostalgia, tender and bittersweet,
A quiet incense in the heart it burns.
It casts a lonesome, longing sheet,
In the past, quietly, the soul turns.

A quiet incense in the heart it burns,
Echoes of laughter, cries of yore,
In the past, quietly, the soul turns,
Seeking solace on memory's shore.

Oh technology, steel and silicon brainchild of yesteryears,
Thy beacons of light, pixels afire in binary chants.
From your loins sprung the world's salvation, and perhaps its fears,
Yes, our world inside a screen, sown with courage, watered with constraints.

Now our hands, bereft of clay or chisel, wield ethereal tools,
We converse in ones and zeroes, love in electronic knolls.
Inspired by your infinite grid, the humble and the fools,
We mould our dreams in the cloud, scribing digital scrolls.

But remember the man behind the machine, the woman behind the wire,
The heart that beats beneath the byte, the soul that refines the code.
Oh sew with wisdom's needle, wield your influence with that austere,
To reap a world bathed in kindness, where humanity is code.

Pantoum of Yesteryears - In the style of Pablo Neruda

In the sepia corners of nostalgia, we dwell,
Trading our present for echoes in time.
Caught behind pixels, in digital shells,
Screens lit with memories, a paradigm.

I rise with the pixels touched by human hands, 
Each thin line of code singing freedom, 
Beyond earth’s grip, where fat satellites stand, 
Connecting souls, echoing the holy kingdom. 

The blossom of worlds within the machine’s nest,
Speaks truths in bytes, beyond whispered rumors,
Slain are distance, time, as east meets west, 
In the screen’s glow, we find our humor. 

Yet, in the pause, I see the lost contact, 
Eyes locked in screens, minds in the ethereal cloud.
Where once humanity in hearts was intact, 
Now silence reigns, loneliness stands proud.

Yet I rise, yet I rise…
Accepting the challenge of this new sunrise.

Encased in metal kingdoms, within silicon shell.
Freedom you granted us, yet also entwined,
In unseen chains of WiFi, connections unconfined.

Libraries in our palms, yet holding distant human hearts,
You're a bitter-sweet symphony, the end as much as the start.
A mirror of humanity, for better or for worse,
In your reflection, we see both blessing and curse.

Bearing the touch of every human intention,
Unity and discord, they echo our voices,
Across the ether, finding no prevention.

Do we dictate or dance to their tune?
Are we the composer or just an instrument?
In the halls of our conjured creation,
Does our humanity face increment or decrement?

As we stand, captivated, on the precipice of the known,
We are but masters on the brink of being minions,
In the chord of innovation that we have intoned.

In the wistful lens of Neruda's prose,
A glimpse of yesteryears begins to compose.
""Her laughter, a melody, echoes and roams,
Around cobblestones of our love, it homes.

In the silent whispers of words unsaid.
Underneath the old willow, our secrets bled,
In the silent whispers of words unsaid.

""Innocence painted our love's tableau,
Echoes and roams, in memories' echo.
Underneath the old willow, where time moves slow,
Innocence painted our love's tableau.""

As seers gazing in the eureka's spark,
We pry open the womb of possibilities, embarking on an ark.
Technology, the modern vessel of our daring dreams,
Yet, in your labyrinth, nothing is as it seems.

Despite the grandeur of the progress we behold,
A creeping specter looms, neither timid nor old.
Beware, whispers the ghost in the machine,
The essence of humanity is not in a screen.

From Apollo's moonshot to Edison's light,
You promised progress, a trophy of human might.
Yet while we danced around your electric fire,
Our spirits were unmoored, with no sacred choir.

Now our souls flicker in digital spaces,
Our love redefined in bytes, not embraces.
Yet, A Technology, I sing your praise and rue,
In the end, we made thee, and now, thee makes us too.

All the world’s a stage, you tell.
Echoing footsteps of Darwin and Galileo,  
In amplitudes of pixels, to high and low.  

Fast as Hermes, with your electric stride,
Bit by bit, you leap wide divides,
But while knowledge blooms across the land,
In man-made desolation, we make our stand.

What is the cost of endless light?
Binding our vision to a small, cold screen,
What dreams of sunlit skies are unseen?

Simultaneously, you’re our map and our road,
Our port in storm, carrying our load.

Cautious must we be, as into your depths we delve,
To use you with wisdom, for all of mankind’s health.
You bring this world at our fingertips,
Oh, may we ensure, it does not slip.

Pantoum of Nostalgia, in the style of Pablo Neruda

Colored glass fragments of the past,
Whispers of love in a silent tune,
Treasures time sewed with a fast,
Fading sunset, rising moon.

Whispers of love in a silent tune,
Snowy footprints in the winter dust,
Fading sunset, rising moon,
Old books gather sepia rust.

Snowy footprints in the winter dust,
Colored glass fragments of the past,
Old books gather sepia rust,
Echoing a love meant to last."
289,14,free,"Ode to the Devices in Maya's Lore

An anthem for the unseen, sung aloft,
Unwired, yet invisibly chained,
Unfurling the fabric of digital cloth,
Wherein the soul of progress is contained.

The echo of voices, dancing in light,
From realm of virtuality, comes the delight.
An omnipresent whisper, an endless sight,
In the matrix we weave of twilights bright.

Yet lost in the brilliance of the azure dome,
We forget the hues of evening's bloom,
For in the cold embrace of chrome,
Lies an alienated gloom.

Oh mighty machines of the digital tide,
Ride the reverberations of time, bide,
In your ones and zeros, truths may hide,
But nothing beats the pulse of life, untried.

Memories Evoke, in the Style of Neruda

Memories eerily call in the still night,
Murmurs from the attic whisper old delight.
Old delight mirrored in forgotten dreams,
Shadows painted with childhood's light.

Murmurs from the attic whisper old delight,
Perfume of nostalgia, an ephemeral flight.
Shadows painted with childhood's light,
In the heart's gallery, a remnant sight.

Perfume of nostalgia, an ephemeral flight,
Memories eerily call in the still night,
In the heart's gallery, a remnant sight,
Memories eerily call in the still night."
290,14,intense,"Ode to Technology

In the ethereal light of computer screens,
Dotting the nighttime landscape, we see the dream.
Humbled by science, silenced in awe,
By electric cradle, the world is upheld.
Yet, are we no more than mere machines,
If luminous screens illuminate our lives?

Passcodes replacing patience, tweets replacing tears,
We march onwards with robotic precision,
Into an age of automated compassion.
In this digital dance, the human spirit perseveres,
Yet do we tread the path of dehumanization,
If metal hearts and silicon sentiments eclipse our years?

But beyond the echo of mechanical melancholy,
I see spheres of possibility undulating,
In the crux of binary triumph and tragedy,
Lies the chance to breed unity – infinite, pulsating.
For aren't we the weavers of technological tapestry?
The hearts behind the hardware, the masters of our machinery.

Stealing the Sunlight – A Nostalgic Pantoum

Sunlight, twice filtered, through yonder’s vine leaves,
The aroma of dreams, in old dusty books,
Something past, yet immaculate, in memories retrieves,
A childhood of laughter, by slow-flowing brooks.

The aroma of dreams, in old dusty books,
The past’s whispered secret, the present denies,
A childhood of laughter, by slow-flowing brooks,
Youthful innocence, where its essence lies.

The past’s whispered secret, the present denies,
It dances with shadows, slipping through fingers,
Youthful innocence, where its essence lies,
Shattered by time, and the regret that still lingers.

Oh brilliant bloom of knowledge, in thy thrall,
Beneath your gaze, humanity stands small.
Is it a bane, or benediction bright?
That binds us in wired embrace, day and night.

Cacophony of voices, losing trace,
In the iridescent glow of cyberspace.
Will wisdom wither beneath your reign?
Or grow, from the trials and tribulation's pain?

Heralded as the harbinger of hope,
Or feared as a formidable, treacherous slope.
Gentle is the hand that steers technology's art,
Its impact, dear beings, is but a reflection of the heart.

PANTOUM: ""Hues of Yesteryear"" in the style of Pablo Neruda

292,14,emotional,"I. An Ode to Technology [In the style of Maya Angelou]

Oh, how the salt of progress has touched our lips,
A bountiful feast of code and wire,
Breathing life into static fingertips, 
Spark of God, Prometheus' fire. 
  
A world once wide, now snug in machine's embrace,
Carving valleys of code, mountains of data risen,
Terrain of silicon, in its bold new face,
Through algorithms, we've realized a new prism. 

In the broadcast of every byte and bit,
At the chapel of screens we kneel,
In the shrine of progress, where humans sit,
A testament to our collective zeal.

By the electron’s hum, the transistor's hymn,
A wired web, of humanity's hymn,
Yet, among the chatter and digital din,
Beam not forget the soul within.

II. A Nostalgic Pantoum [In the style of Pablo Neruda]

Childhood reveries draped in gold,
Present echoes of an age, not so old.
A fabled time when moons felt near,
Tales whispered by the sea I’d hear.

Oh dauntless dreamers of silicon dreams,
In your hands you hold the global reins.
Against a backdrop of pixelated screens,
The spectrum of human existence gains.

From the hallowed depths of the human mind,
To the iron fingertips of steel,
We've danced a dance with binary kind,
To rhythms unearthly and surreal.

A confluence of thought and touch,
Invisible waves cross mountains and sea.
The world's grown small under technology's clutch,
As borders blur into unity.

Yet, oh the hearts that echo lonely,
As silent screens light shadows deep.
Lonely child cradles smartphone only,
While companionship's promise we fail to keep.

With these bionic dreams, in silicon seams,
Do we forget the warmth of skin?
And so it seems, beneath moon's beams,
We are less outside, yet less within.

So, dear dreamer, craft with care,
For in your hands, the power abounds.
Use tech to bridge, to mend, to share,
Let heart and tech dance on common grounds.

Oh, pulsing child of silicon and steel,
Arrayed in ones and zeroes, under cosmic sky,
You’ve ushered in a new world order,
Awakening echoes of tomorrow in our hearts.
Intricate as a sunflower's golden spiral, bright and bold,
And like a hummingbird, you’ve bridged the chasms of our minds.

Capable hands of humanity’s collective spirit,
Chiseled you from raw, unformed imaginings.
A moon-shot dream forged within our swooning grasp,
Oh, dearest tool, to some derisive and yet, prevailing.

Yet as the tides, the sun, the moon, in nature’s grand ballet,
You’ve danced with us across time’s shifting sands.
And though your dance is young, just beginning,
Its impact, like footprints on virgin snow, is deep and everlasting.

Pantoum of Nostalgia in the style of Pablo Neruda

A whisper in the wind, tales of yore.
Each year passed is a petal dropped.
Memory, a sweet wine we pour,
A time-kissed photograph, heart-stopped.

The echo of laughter in empty halls.

Thou digital whisper that breaks nature's silence.
Thine allure bathes us in the ink of progress,
Invisible fibers bind us, deafening distance.
Our hearts drum the rhythm of ones and zeros.
Thy touch, a mystical tablet, decoding human frailty.

We reach, oh the reach of us all,
Through steel and glass, transgressing time's finality. 
Our truths, broadcast in pulsar beats, echo in cosmic halls,
A human collective, bound in virtual reality.

Pablo Neruda Inspired Pantoum, On Nostalgia:

The slackened cobweb sways in time,
Haunted swings stand empty, aloof.
Old whispers wind the ancient pine,
From castle folly to tin roof.

In the hollow of memories' puppet show.

Oh Tech, with your flickering light, you lay bare our nights,
Brought the world close, made distant lands neighbors.
Oh conveyor of voices, silent yet loud,
Anchored in pockets, power held, power displayed.

Words danced across screens, and we danced with them,
The swift tap and slide become our new language.
Is this not unity - An anthem sung in binary?
Yet complexities wake, shadowing our light.

Through you we find connection, yet seek it further,
Screens sleep while hearts awake, longing, waiting.
Turned inward, turned outward, revolving in silence,
We lost ourselves in you, found others in exchange.

Nostalgia (in the style of Pablo Neruda, Pantoum structure, 40 words)

The old record spins, an echo of laughter prevails,
In the dusty attic, nostalgia breathes stories.
Remembering the hushed whispers of lovers, time trails,
Unfolding memories like scrolled golden theories.

This relic of our modern human grace,
Where words we weave, in circuits' warm embrace.
Oh, bind us not, dear Web, in cold disdain,
Our spirits fly on fiber optic's trace.

Words spun in coded lace stitch life's refrain,
Fingers fly, on keyboards they maintain,
Threads of thought that cross Earth's vast domain,
Just to learn they're drops in data's ocean, caught in vain.

But still, we dance, unfettered by the chain,
Of progress cloaked in silicon's campaign,
Pulsing veins of electricity unchained,
Breathing life, and death, across our wired plain.

We query, and the screens pulse back, arcane,
Reply in tongues that only circuits feign,
Oh, bind us not, dear Web, in cold disdain,
We humans live and love, beyond what’s typed in vain.

In faded photographs, the past encased,
Lost and found in time’s relentless chase.
Nostalgic hum rings in old tunes played,

To dream, to connect, to voice what's inside.

Blazing data, spangled network weaved,
In every fibre of life, your circuit threads that swelled,
Once were we shackled, now, by you, relieved,
In your matrix, our dreams, hopes and fears are held.

With this silent speech, unending, profound.
Indeed, technology, in us you are bound,
Raising us higher, our reach has no ground.

In your pulse, economy thrives.
Replacing labor with steel and wire,
Fulfill the human heart's unending desire.

We marvel, as you shrink space and time,
Spinning tales in binary rhyme.
Yet warns the lark at early light,
Captured in your net, we lose the sight.

A gift you are, yet also a test,
In every algorithm expressed.
We've learnt the moon's silent song,
But forgot language to which we belong.

Messages in bottles, now compressed,
To share our thoughts, feelings expressed.
Yet in the shadows, a silent yearn,
For the days of yore, does return.

Oh, mighty tech, we cannot deny,
Your value in these times so wry.
Yet within us echoes a silent plea,
Never forget our humanity.

High 'n low, night 'n day, man, what a journey.

Starry sky my Marlon Brando, night's soliloquy,
Each stop a story, each tale a journey.

Ale in hand, jazz in soul, ain't life a journey?
Man, through every gas engine moan, I feel the journey."

Flickering towns whispering dreams, traveler's journey never spent.

Hope's in hitched rides, under nomad moon's crescent,
Every road, every mile, a prayer, a traveler's journey never spent."
603,30,modern,"On neon streets, the traveller spills time, journey raw and free.
In chrome-clad dreams, he sails, journey embraces sea.

In motel whispers, halts his journey, soulful and discreet."

Windows whisper, winds implore, endless roads, the traveller's lore.

Soul's tapestry, each thread, an unseen shore.
Unbound, unchained, elusive score, inked in heart, the traveller's lore."
605,30,funny,"On the road with rifled raiment, runs the riotous rover, Ray.
Mismatched socks, a joke, one black, one gray.

Maps malign in cosmic comedy, show oceans where deserts lay,
In distant diners, does his starstruck way.

Wine-filled flask, 'neath star-kissed skies, gone astray,
Dreamer, drifting, in Kerouac's playful play.

Twilight tales spun loose, 'midst laughter's light ballet,
Laughing loudest, he whose path is farthest away."
606,30,romantic,"On freeways kissed by moonlight, a traveller's soul would confide,
In every path, a lover's tale, of journeys long been plied.

Chasing the sunset's crimson echo, in dream's vast sea he'd wade,
Each town a verse, each hill a sigh, in heart's wandering serenade."
607,30,cynical,"In dreams of gold, the traveller’s journey coerces, implicates,
A hollow road, dressed in sunshine, jovaciously sedates.

In each town’s corner, same sad faces, an echo reincarnates,
On this traveller’s journey, humanity stagnates. 

Malcontented freedom, in vagrant suitcases, accumulates,
Oh, this cynical traveller’s journey, how it isolates."

Fragments of existence, a lone traveller's space.

Each dawn anew, in freedom, the heart's mysterious journeys.

Esteemed stars guide, the moon in quiet glow,
Not bound, nor confined, oh, the vagabond’s journeys.

In the hum of tires, whispers the unseen,
Chasing horizons, the lonesome echo of journeys. 

Unmapped routes, under wild blue yonder,
Kerouac's ghost, in the songs of our journeys."
610,30,intense,"On lost highways of the soul, rides the lonesome traveller unknown.
Battered shoes, etched by treads of stories, lonelier paths, even more so, grown.

Stars his map, moon his compass, navigates the heart's wild zone,
Bearing dreams in a dust-caked knapsack, a world, within a traveller unknown."
611,30,relaxed,"On lonesome roads, the traveller finds his creed,
In new-found faces, cross-country speed.

Soul stirred by jazz notes in desert's breeze,
In this great mystery, wanderer finds his ease. 

Endless pursuit of dreams, truly freed,
That's the song of a Kerouac's bead."
612,30,emotional,"In twilight's hush, a traveller's heart dreaming, rove afar,
Finds solace undiscovered by those who never roam.

Stars whisper of distant tales, tales of love and scar,
On a lonely highway, found a traveller's only home.

Mountains kissed by dawn, awaken dreams, serene yet bizarre,
In every sunrise, a poetic tome for each wandering gnome.

Miles applaud the sirens of the journey, they never aim to mar,
In this wayfarer's silence, sits a universe's poem."
613,30,rational,"On lost roads, the traveller drifts, clutching hope, dear
Where destination lies unclear, freedom's the code, dear.

Beyond earthly bounds, chasing a vagabond's dream,
The journey's the treasure trove, road is abode, dear.

Love, life bled in ink, narrated in silent teardrops,
Unravelling stories sowed in traveller's ode, dear."
614,30,profound,"Beyond horizons, dreams aren’t shy, echo the traveller’s sky-bound cry.
Roads unfettered, words unsaid, muse the traveller's journey, in silence bred.

His compass, a reckless scribe tells no lie,
Ink-drawn tales coax the weary traveller's eye.

In starlight or storm, each mile a sigh,
Carries the subtle secrets of a traveller’s lullaby."
615,30,superficial,"In open lands where tire marks allower, seeks the solitary traveller.
Silent whispers of stars' slumber, echo dreams to the vagabond traveller.

Each dawn a new horizon, dusk paints a foreign silhouette,
Kerouac maps hidden in tobacco pockets, guide the restless traveller. 

Feasting on roadside diners, slumbering in motels of transient allure,
The chrome-plated highway beckons, and on bounds the merry traveller. 

Life in transient snapshots, cities blend in a blurred palette,
Yet thirsts for the unknown roads, the perpetual traveller."
616,30,expressive,"Beneath moon's gaze, road unwinds, traveller forays; soul's journey this.
Dust-strewn shoes tap rhythms of whispers, echoing in abyss.

Nights dressed in neon lure, tales in taverns spun sharp and hazy,
Traveller, find answers 'midst laughter and pennies, in life's thrilling jazzy.

Across the miles of solitude, dream-catcher in tow, he marches,
Inked in memory, woven into timeless arches.

Road, the teacher; traveller, the eternal student in auroral processions,
Swift pulse of headlights, illuminating truth in transient lessons."
617,30,restrained,"Upon dusty roadways, freedom yearns, lone traveler's journey.
In silence, heart beats, unending, an internal journey.

Midnight's solace whispers tales, secrets of the journey.

Beat drum of solitude, muse of the lonely journey,
Kerouac soul echoes, pen scribes the lone journey."
618,30,happy,"Afoot, ablaze, within the traveler's soul, rails unfurl, under journey's toll. 
Kerouac's ghost whispers in twilight's glow, this, the journey, and the boon we know. 
Across the miles, beneath the boundless sky, each heartbeat echoes in the traveler's cry. 
In unity with road and verse, heaven is found, the world traversed. 
In freedom's grasp, a joy sublime, this radiant road, this expansive time. 
Life - the journey, the traveler's glee, in every moment, the soul is free."
619,30,sad,"On the road, a lone and weary soul finds bray,

Time's cruel jest, a traveller's journey astray."
620,31,formal,"When dawn, in vibrant hues, unfolds the day,
Across the Mississippi's age-worn face.
The night surrenders, shadows flee away,
To let morn's light her darkened canvas trace.

Twin orbs of fire burst with brilliance drawn,
Light dances on the waterfront's embrace. 
A sonnet sweet as riverboat's song,
Heralds the marvel of a new day's chase.

Yet fleeting are these moments of bright spawn,
Like river's journey to the ocean's base.
Ephemeral as a fawn's first dawn,
Or discarded cider in old Twain's misplaced.

In measured verse, while dawn does yawn,
we pay our homage to the mortal race."
621,31,informal,"Dawn creeps, like a rascal stealing cream,
Yawning night gives way, begins to dream.

In sheer delight, a new day to name."
622,31,traditional,"Dark corners yield to kiss of morning light,
The breaking dawn chases old night away.
Silent wonders tattered by first light,
Hushed whispers of night vanished by day.

Foothold of blind creep, sun begins to play,
Giving birth anew to the canvas of sight.
With nature’s tune, begins the serenade,
Every morning song reclaims its right.

Morning’s first blush paints with tranquil might,
Crafting the dawn with a quiet command.
Every creature bends to the glorious sight,
Emerging from night, guided by gentle hand.

So, dawn arrives upon every land,
New life sprung forth, by light's honest demand."

Twain-esque prose adorns the morning so right.
Day's arrival, old as Noah’s ark,

Scribed sonnet, in dawn's first task."
624,31,serious,"Ruthless darkness bows to dawn's decree,
Night’s reign ends, in radiance we see,
Piercing mists atop river's yawn,
Echoed whispers of a nascent morn.
Daylight breaks, shadows flee,
Entities illuminate, in fear set free.
A moment's peace, all strife withdrawn,
Behold! The breaking of the dawn."
625,31,funny,"At dawn, I met the rising sun with a yawn,  
In night's attire, my pajamas worn.
Only one cuckoo crowed that morn,
A chicken, confused, beating popcorn!  
Fourteen lines, yes, but where's my dawn?  
Rising sun cast aside, by a bird, misinformed."

Day's birth bestows a tome of sweet delight."
627,31,cynical,"Morn's first light does break, so we're told, so bright,
Yet brings naught but labors harsh and forthright.

'Neath veils of night, hearts yearn for morn's light.
Through darkness, whispers of hope take flight,
Unto the east, the sun takes its rightful sight.

As shadows slink, daydreams start to weave,
In the hush of twilight, we believe.
Gilded hopes on the horizon heave,
In the break of dawn, we receive, conceive.

Emerald fields with dewdrops are fraught,
In mirth of morn, silence is sought.
Day's first sunbeam, a blessing sought,
Grace of dawn, a splendid thought.

Breaking dawn, life's fervent sonnet,
A new day born, as night's bonnet is doffed."
629,31,free,"Upon yonder dawn, the night does yield,
Its stars retreat, as morn is unsealed.
Golden light over the world is thrown,
The mystery of dark, by day is overthrown.

Nature's clock, in silence, ticks on,
Evoking daybreak, as a gentle song.
Man and beast awaken, free,
Embracing the truth - what will be, will be.

Awaiting stories, by the sun drawn,
In noble silence, breaks the dawn."

Riveting saga of daybreak, in hues of gold,

Welcomes a day, night's shadows being drawn.
Sun ambling high, interrupts the gentle yawn,
With a picture pure, like a freshly born fawn.
Ah, sweet the solace in the breaking of dawn."
632,31,emotional,"Dawn's break, the gentle hush 'fore morn’s parade,
Unveils a world draped in silent rebirth.
Her quiet tones bleed through darkness' shade,
Instilling life no wealth could gauge in worth.

Though morning's lure woos the weary night,
Stars fade, their stories inked in daybreak's light.

In unveiling life, her tears, everything,
Twain whispers 'gainst dawn's gentle, gold threading,
Pain echoed in the sparrow’s solemn ring,
Known only through the heart’s deep, silent reading.

As dawn comes forth in radiant, shifting streams,
So too, is life, a river of light-beamed dreams."
633,31,rational,"The dark shroud lifts as dawn starts to yawn,
Hues of gold, whispers of Mark Twain's lore.
In the silent serenade of morn alone, 
Is a tale of beauty the Mississippi shores adore.

Faint stir of life, the awake flora fawn,
Rays kiss earth, a scene, richly ornate.
Breaking dawn, each day reborn,
An artist's canvas elucidates.

The river's mirror, the sun's early light borne,
Reflecting the purity of God's own mate.
Through Twain's words, a new day is drawn,
In dawn's glory, we celebrate.

Thus does light, through darkness torn,
Reveal a world, dawn invigorate."
634,31,profound,"In dawn's soft breaking, there lies a nudge,
Of joyous solitude, to which no man begrudge.
Light crows, it stretches, yawning wide,
Awakening the sleeping earth, removed the night's tide.
Twain's truth, dawn reveals, never to misjudge,
Each morning's birth, life's sweetest judge.
The day commences, poets convene,
A quiet communion, on life's rich scene.  
O'er river's mirror morning's blush,
Sparks creation's unending hush.
Humble heart, in tender awe,
Salutes this mystic law,
The breaking dawn -- day's gentlest applause,
And humankind, in its endless cause."
635,31,superficial,"As dawn doth break on Mississippi's might,
A golden burst that casts away night's game,
Each cretin cooing 'gainst the morning light,
A superficial play, in day's first flame.

No deep despair, no poignant truth to tell,
Just Dawn's soft kiss upon the sleepy land.
A sight as simple as an old town bell,
In Twain's plain tone, we come to understand.

Yet though it lacks a deeper, darker strain,
Enough it is, this break of day's delight.

No need for sorrow, angst, or life's cruel pain,
When dawn's first blush puts star-kissed night to flight."
636,31,expressive,"When Dawn does break, its golden fire ignites
Resigned 'gainst black, and colors burst untamed.
Nature's reckoning, twixt broad day and night
Which swords of light, triumph 'gainst dark, have claimed.

The dancing shadows flee, the rooster speaks,
Proclaiming day, echo'd by morning's might.
And man yields to this course, as twilight sneaks
To claim the throne, at Day’s noble fight.

Sweet Dawn, with crimson glory, do you break,
And silence Night’s whispering, mournful song.
With your arrival, sleeping world awake,
A rebirth daily, as light proves strong.

‘Tis Dawn's decree, each morn anew begun,
Such is life’s cycle: the setting, rising sun."

Softly whispers of light have begun.
Through the veil of night, radiance blurs,
In subtle hues, the star yields to sun.

Shadows flee, as daylight is spun,
New day's promise gently tugs, no haste,
Chilly grasp of nightfall undone,
Dreams of dark are soon effaced.

In still silence, the serenade starts,
Nature’s verse, pure and untooled,
Easing gently the retiring night’s parts,
With dawn’s tender kiss, the earth is schooled.

In this subdued break, life’s lore is drawn,
Such is the splendor of humble dawn."
638,31,happy,"As dawn breaks, the rooster sings a tune,
Warm rays peek above yonder dune.
Twain's pen tells, glad the night has gone,
The Mississippi awakes, kissed by the dawn.
Laughter echoes; a new day's boon,
Life's splendors bloom ne'er too soon."
639,31,sad,"Upon the tarnished canvas of morning’s light,
In borrowed threads of hope, dawn's heartbreak sewn,
Mark Twain’s pen doth trace the morn’s sad sight,
A dirge for tranquillity's twilight, flown. 
Oh! Dawn's break, both gift and woe - now shown."

Beneath the shadows, truths take flight,
Old tales untold, a chilled night's bone,

Empty is the choir, the songbird's sight,
Once flourishing, now silently overgrown,
In enchanted woods, great oaks lament the light.

A sorrowed sigh stirs frosty twilight,
The woods' deep sorrow, to the winds unknown,

Scarlet lightning, like dawn's early morn,
Flames 'gainst the night, its tranquility shorn.

Her lashing winds in crescendos do roar,
In darkness, traceried by electric light.
In awe we stand, upon the trembling shore,
In heart of night, we find a wild delight.

Her reign's marked by the drumroll of the rain,
A symphony of force, in majesty.
And in her aftermath we find the stain,
Of beauty born from fearsome anarchy.

So sings the storm, in potent harmony,
And we, but humble scribes of her decree."
763,38,modern,"In darkness sequined silver, nature roars,

Draws gasping breaths from hearts frozen in awe.
Rain's lusty dance on rooftops freshly made,
Strums a rhythm both mighty and raw.

On storm-glass stage, a swirling spectacle,
Draped with stormy passion, none can hide.
In chaotic sky, a script less tactical,
Earth playwright’s tale of pride and tide.

Oh, marvel, in this technicolor dream,

Illusion of beckoned victory.

Naught but jest in grim, cosmic decree.

Tossed in gales of blind, uncaring might,
Yet, we glow with juvenile delight.
Murky ignorance, man's gentle blight,
Storm's cruel jest, dressed as valiant fight.

We stand as kings, ere the thunder's roar,
Bedazzled fools on the tempest's shore."

Unfettered fury stakes its claim,

Stars shy to the tempest's resplendent vamp.
An ardent affair of cloud and clam,
Chaos, caressed by tranquility’s lamp.

Fear wrestled, mastered, in beauty reborn,
In silver lattices, the storm thus speaks.
From vast tumult, profound peace is drawn,
An excited serenity, nature tweaks.

Thrashing waves upon our ship's frail form.

We find majestic thrill within the storm.

Merciless tempest, yet a sight divine,
Whispers of life's unyielding, pervasive charm,
Seeking not shelter, but the lightning's sign,
Reveling in chaos, yet finding calm.

Unknown, unbidden, fierce the winds that howl,
Their mighty gusts seize breath and fill our chests.
In each grand clash, each whisper, each growl,
Lie nature's truths and testing, where life invests.

In storms we learn the grit to brave each gale,
Finding peace amidst the endless detail.

Held breath, in trembling nature's pawn,
In grey-dark depths, life's song reborn.
A symphony crescendo, the silent horn,
The pulse of chaos, in restraint, adorned. 

A promise surreal, the fear torn,
By tempest's passion, comfort is shorn.
Yet, no dread, but quiet awe worn,
In the tempest's eye, a serenity sworn.

Quietly stirs the soul, to the storm's scorn, 
Striking serenity’s poise, amid chaos forlorn."

Lightning: the conductor's baton ignites.
Rain sings the melody, pure and bright,
In chaos, nature's orchestra unites.

Despite the fear that storms oft arouse,
One's heart leaps, enchantment thus endows.
Each gust, each flash, our spirits they espouse,
Offering wonder's thrill as vow and spouse.

In storm's grandeur, we find a gleeful tune,
Dancing beneath the jesting tempest moon."

Greet thunder’s cry, in the shadows drawn.

A lament wails midst lightning, unsheathed. 
Robbed of peace, yet gifted dread,
And still-- life treads, ever ahead.

In hope's dear plight, seeks morning’s light.

In whispers stored, our hearts defend.
From Southern soil, a sigh ascends,
Inhaled by those who'll not pretend,
That wind's soft whispers will impend,
Truth's urgent message, love extend.
On modern strings of time it depends,
The whispering wind - our timeless friend."
924,46,serious,"In mute meadows, where a secret blows,
A hush that dances with trembling reeds,
Whisper, a flutter unseen, bestows
Tales spun in sinewy, somber seeds.

Breath of life, the world in your hand,
Unseen architect of shifting sand,
Paints stories on leaf, and grainy strand,
Silent sonnet scribed by spectral hand.

Wind's whisper, cryptic language unfold,
A symphony across the threshold,
Unsung verses of time retold,
In the silent gust, a tale is told."
925,46,funny,"Whispering winds, tell your tale bold,
About the unseen and the untold.
Do you tickle leaves as you pass,
Or prankishly knock over someone's glass?
Forgive our laughter, swiftly borne,
Upon each gust, each prankish scorn."
926,46,romantic,"In the hush, heartbeats echo, the wind's soft sigh,
A lover's whisper, under the Alabama sky.
Veiling moonlight secrets, hidden in tall pines,
Sweet breath of Dixie, where love intertwines.
His voice in her ear, quietly it begins,
A testament of love, on the whisper of the winds."
927,46,cynical,"In silent whispers doth the treacherous wind,
Reveal tales to trees, deceitful, unkind.
What cynics are we, who heed not its tale,
Weeping for truths lost in a sly gale.
With each rustle, a falsehood it doth grind."
928,46,rhythmic,"In silent dusk, the wind does softly play,
A lonesome tune through leaves of grand old trees,
A secret song, cryptic in its breezy way,
That dances in the air with such gentle ease.

’Tis but the hush of nature, whispering in plea,
The cool caress amidst the Southern heat,
Telling stories of the past, in reverie,
Its spirited melody, rhythmically sweet.

In quiet surrender, night kneels to the dawn,
Thus the wind's whispers ever softly sweep,
In life's eternal dance, a pact is drawn,
The echoes of which, in our hearts, we keep."
929,46,free,"Through quiet cottonwoods, in hushed delight,
A whisper leaks, distilling Southern eve,
A secret shared 'neath stars' impartial light,
As wind and soul in tranquil dance conceive. 

No shackles bind this breeze in flight, nor sorrow,
It's free, like Mockingbird's pure lilting tune,
Its message carried forth until tomorrow,
By sacred cipher of the pale-faced moon. 

Free as whispered tales afore our ken,
It sows its silence in the ears of men."
930,46,intense,"Whispered secrets, by the wind undressed,
Echo 'midst the swaying trees to find.
In dusk's serene, its tale confessed,
A ghostly siren that unwinds.

Each hush of night yields solace pure,
In veiled tales, inscribed by time.
To speak of love, and pain endure,
In every chilling chime.

Barely touched, yet fiercely felt,
In silence stirs a tempest's might.
Unseen, unbound, makes hushed hearts melt,
Across the breadth of lonesome night.

Each gust a verse, each breeze a line,
The wind's soft whisper... eternally divine."
931,46,relaxed,"In whispered lullaby of Zephyr's sigh,
Twixt emerald leaves, it spins a tale so kind.
A silent voice, in twirling dance does bind,
In tranquil notes that color evening's sky.
A hushed song of day's end, by and by,
E'er gentle, even winds of chance unwind.
Yet, whisper grants no answer, to any kind they grind,
In swirling dance beneath the indigo dye.
The echo of the cosmos found herein,
In softest strain of the rustling reed.
This ancient wind, too quiet to impede,
Sings amidst stars, our world's enduring kin.
Soft cascade of the night, lush and deep,
In lullaby, the wind cradles the world to sleep."
932,46,emotional,"In whispers soft the wind does play,
Gentle secrets it conveys,
Through leaves of green and fields of gray,
Bearing tales of yesteryears' days.

Silent sorrows, joy's bright ray,
Shared in its ceaseless, roaming ballet.
Dawn or dusk, come what may,
Binds all hearts in its unseen fillet.

Reflected in the river's spray,
Echoed in the lark's faraway lay,
An unseen thread links life's array,
Woven in the wind's endless replay. 

Lamenting not, nor feigned display,
Just love's remnant in disarray."
933,46,rational,"Upon yonder meadow, the wind speaks soft,
Tales woven in hushed tones of loft.
Whispers that dance in cottonwood bough,
Singing soliloquies of now.
Caressing frail petals in tender bind,
Invisible verses, to mankind.
A gentle echo of nature’s hymn,
The whispering secrets of the wind."
934,46,profound,"Whispering wind, 'neath the magnolia tree,
Softly speaks secrets in hushed, humble tones.
Its tales echo fields of cotton, once free,
In sighing song, history bemoans.

Carried on breezy, lonesome southern gust,
Echoes of haints, and truths unseen.
A testament of life, of lore we trust,
Offered in each chime of the forest's green.

Invisible, pervasive and profound,
Its voice a constant in changing clime.
In stillness, its silent stories resound,
An endless echo of forgotten time. 

The whispering wind, so frail yet so bold,
Speaks for the voiceless, their stories it holds."
935,46,superficial,"The wind whispers soft, 'neath the moon's pallid glow,
Evening's faint sigh through the slumbering lee,
Of tales untold, secrets no man can know,
In hushed dance of drizzle, between land and sea."
936,46,expressive,"In quiet whispering, tales does the wind weave,
From yonder to here, nature's soft sigh believed,
Through magnolia blooms, it merrily grieves,
Beneath mockingbird wings, promises conceived.

Fleeting whispers borne aloft, secrets perceived,
Each rustling leaf a testament received,
Invisible weaver, truth interweaved,
Echoes of Harper, in wind's web we believe. 

Oh! Wind, bring a whisper, a gentle reprieve,
Mirth of yesteryears, forlorn tales of Eve.
Your voice, a balm, for the hearts that grieve,
In your poignant story, we ardently believe. 

So hush and listen, to words the wind perceives,
In silence and whispers, Harper's legacy lives."
937,46,restrained,"Hush, whispers the breeze to its timeless trees,
In Harper's gentle, restrained decree.
Chiding leaves, painting tales in subtle spree,
Binding worlds in quiet, unhurried ease.
In daylight's shadow or moon's soft tease,
It sings lullabies of countless seas.
Each breath, a sonnet drawn delicately free, 
In the hallowed depth of silent peace."
938,46,happy,"With wind's soft whisper, joy in air doth spin,
Unseen but felt, with quiet, zephyr dance.
In leafy trees, its secret tale begins,
A merry chant, sung in mild romance. 

Through meadows lush and wafting seeds of tin,
It stirs the glades in gentle, playful prance. 
Each tender sigh of breezy, warm refrain,
Compose a symphony in nature's stance.

Beloved Wind, your voice a soothing balm,
You float on high, where heaven's arbor ends.
Bearing wild freedom in your balmy psalm,
A serenade to life, your song extends.

In whispers soft, the heart of day you mend,
A sweet companion, the Wind, our unseen friend."
939,46,sad,"In Lee's voice whispers dwells, as hush of wind,
In melancholic gaze, through autumn's sigh.

Etching tales on hearts, unspoken, lined,
An elegy for days that softly die."

Strategies of lust masked as nature’s ballet.

With Aurora's flame in celestial flight.
Mountainous silence whispers of unknown thrill,
Rivers run free, obeying no will.

In the wilderness, true selves are found.
Here, heart and soul align and blend,
Called to the wilderness, man's best friend."

Stirs the spirit of a deep, ancient bark.
Primal echoes through the menagerie wild,
Nature's call to her feral child.
A symphony raw, a mystery unfurled,
An untamed anthem in this world.

In solitude's quilt, the wilderness lay,
A beacon for lost, the wild's ballet.

Raven's prophecy in the frosted twine,
Truth in raw, where rapturous secrets start,
In the whispering wind, primal and divine.

The wild's call, fervor mounts astound,
In abyss of instincts, mortal fear is bound."

In resonance with the beast unconfined,
The call echoing, in primordial mind,
Unleashes passion--man and wild entwined."

Splendid solitude in nature's thrall.

Hearken, answers the soul, to the wild's draw."

The wild's call reverberates, raw and deep,
A primal urge in man’s heart begins to grow,
Awakens the soul from its dreamscape sleep. 

Shadows of peaks, whisper secrets untold,
Guiding spirit adrift, surging and bold. 
Discarding the fetters of cultured decree,
In nature’s arms, man discovers he's free.

Heed the call, wild heart, with ease.
In wilderness true, awaits the test,
A call to the wild, manifest."

Twisting 'midst the storm, where the brave stars hide.
Nature's rugged voice, stark and wild and free,
Exalts the primal song, man's heart beside.
In man's soul doth the feral echoes ride,
Rousing the grandeur of untraveled time.
Yet tethered by civilization's pride,
Oft their true essence remains a sublime rhyme,
That sounds in the wind, vistas yet to climb,
A call wrapped in the wilderness' grand thrum.
Thus, paint the spirit beyond worldly crime,
In places where city din becomes dumb.
Drawn to this wild land, fraught with strife and rife,
Wherein lies the raw and vital pulse of life."

Calls unto souls where civil echoes fade.

In wild's embrace, man's spirit shall reside."

Freedom's call, where hearts belong,
Nature's lullaby, is pure delight.

Untamed winds tell tales, old and grand,

In its beautiful chaos, be beguiled."

Trapped, bound in civilization's tight slight."

Frail hope born from dread’s pew.
This sleep, a crypt, unrest denied,
In a dream, all secrets hide."

A nightmare in the infinite reap,
For life is but a nightmare steep."
